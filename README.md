# TypeOS-2
New version of TypeOS with a command line
This version uses VGA 256 color 320x200 mode instead of text mode used in the cli version
other than that the OS runs almost identical to the cli version just with a different font
the code however has huge differences in the way it was written and has a few more display related functions than the cli version
